Name,Description,Status
MARINE VESSEL DATA ANALYTICS,"High volume data replication of (4Hz) sensor data (accelerometers, strain guages, etc. ) from two large floating offshore O&G facilities.  Statistical down-sampled versions of the data are created and stored to enable responsive data visualization and drill-down analysis by Engineers of vessel response.   Analysis and classification of data peaks & limit exceedances is automated. ",2016-PRESENT
SAFETY ANALYTICS,Solution for gathering & collating leading safety risk data from a variety of sources and calculating a combined incident likelihood score for global construction/operations contracts.  Insights are presented in a highly interactive incident risk dashboard that is used by HSE senior management to identify contracts requiring intervention.,2019-PRESENT
PROCESS ANOMALY MACHINE LEARNING,Solution for identifying process anomalies (e.g. flow conditions associated with loss of containment) for detailed examination by subsea ops engineers. The solution enables automatic generation of quarterly reports (on status/close-out of  anomalies) & creation of an information-rich database (i.e. data patterns of interest with classification & action) that will be used for training advanced prescriptive models to enhance the solution in future releases.,2018-PRESENT
CONSULTATION ANALYTICS (APERTURE),Web-app for conducting public consultations analytics on large infrastructure projects.  Solution allows 100s users from the consultation team to simultaneously analyze anonymized consultation responses and assign key consultation themes/codes.  ML is used to identify spurious campaign responses and improve quality of the coding by automatically identifying themes/codes that are likely to be a bad fit or made in error.,2018-PRESENT
PIPELINE VIBRATION ANALYTICS,Web-based viewer and analysis tool that is used to import and process large volumes of high-resolution valve actuator signature data (pressures and injected fluid volumes).  A machine learning model within the application is used to perform 1st pass classification of valve signatures with the goal of identifying gradual state changes.,2020-PRESENT
MARINE VESSEL OPERABILITY,"Web-application for performing vessel operability studies for selected geographical locations.  The application analyses site specific historic environmental data (wave, wind and tide) as well as bathymetric data (when relevant) to determine statistics of likely vessel availability for construction campaigns and floating facilty operations (e.g. LNG loading/offloading for floating units).",2020-PRESENT
VALVE ACTUATOR SIGNATURE PREDICIVE ANALYTICS,"Solution for importing & processing large volumes of high-resolution valve actuator signature data (pressures & injected fluid volumes).  ML within the application is used to perform 1st pass classification of valve signatures with the goal of identifying gradual state changes, i.e. healthy actuators starting to degrade and move towards functional failure.  Engineers use the application to perform all reporting on valve actuator condition.  The machine learning, advanced data visualization and data ingestion and storage capabilities of the app significantly reduce the effort required to monitor the condition of these operation-critical pieces of equipment.",2016-PRESENT
